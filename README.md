# My Store

This is an app built based on [this video](https://youtu.be/DgPcpte1eoA).
In this web app I am using TypeScript, NextJS, ChakraUI, Google sheets and the WhatsApp API.

In this page you can select the desired products and when proceeding to the checkout, you will be redirected to a WhatsApp profile.
I am using Google Sheets as the database, so every product that is registered there will appear on the frontend.
